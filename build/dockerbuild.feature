  Scenario Outline: Push build with invalid github repo
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/build/ruby22rhel7-template-sti-invalidrepo.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | template | ruby-helloworld-sample |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "ruby22-sample-build-1" build was created
    And the "ruby22-sample-build-1" build failed
    When I run the :logs client command with:
      | resource_name | bc/ruby22-sample-build |
    Then the output should contain "<warning>"

    Examples:
      | warning                                      |
