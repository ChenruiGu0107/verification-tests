  Scenario: The network between projects are flat and can be managed by admin when using networkpolicy plugin
    Given the env is using networkpolicy plugin
    # create project and pods
    Given I have a project
    And evaluation of `project.name` is stored in the :proj1 clipboard
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/networking/list_for_pods.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given 2 pods become ready with labels:
      | name=test-pods |
    And evaluation of `pod(0).ip` is stored in the :p1pod1ip clipboard
    And evaluation of `pod(1).ip` is stored in the :p1pod2ip clipboard
    And evaluation of `pod(0).name` is stored in the :p1pod1 clipboard

    Given I create a new project
    And evaluation of `project.name` is stored in the :proj2 clipboard
    When I run the :create client command with:

    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain "Hello"

    When I execute on the "<%= cb.p2pod2 %>" pod:
      | curl | --connect-timeout | 5 | <%= cb.p1pod2ip %>:8080 |
    Then the step should succeed

    Given the DefaultDeny policy is applied to the "<%= cb.proj1 %>" namespace
    Then the step should succeed

    And the output should not contain "Hello"
    Given I use the "<%= cb.proj2 %>" project
    When I execute on the "<%= cb.p2pod2 %>" pod:
