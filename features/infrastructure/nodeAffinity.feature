  Scenario Outline: pod prefers to be scheduled to the nodes which matches affinity rules
    Given environment has at least 2 schedulable nodes
    Given I run commands on all masters:

    Then the step should succeed
    Given master config is merged with the following hash:
    """
    kubernetesMasterConfig:
      schedulerConfigFile: /etc/origin/master/<scheduler_file>
    """
    And the master service is restarted on all master nodes
    And I store the schedulable nodes in the :nodes clipboard
    And label "<label>" is added to the "<%= cb.nodes[0].name %>" node
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I have a project

    Then the expression should be true> pod.node_name == cb.nodes[0].name
    Examples:
      | scheduler_file                          | label                         | pod_file_name                 |
      | scheduler_nodeaffinity_priority_10.json | beta.kubernetes.io/arch=intel | node-anti-affinity-preferred  | # @case_id OCP-14505
      | scheduler_nodeaffinity_priority_10.json | zone=us                       | node-affinity-preferred-us    | # @case_id OCP-14498
