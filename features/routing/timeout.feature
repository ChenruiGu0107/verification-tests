  Scenario: Set timeout server for unsecure route
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f  |  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/routetimeout/httpbin-pod.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And all pods in the project are ready
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f  | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/routetimeout/unsecure/service_unsecure.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I wait for the "service-unsecure" service to become ready
    When I expose the "service-unsecure" service
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :annotate client command with:
      | resource         | route                                  |

      | keyval           | haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=3s |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I open web server via the "http://<%= route.dns(by: user) %>/delay/1" url
    Then the step should succeed
    Then the output should contain:
      | "X-Forwarded-Host": "service-unsecure |
      | delay/1                               |
    When I open web server via the "http://<%= route.dns(by: user) %>/delay/5" url
    Then the output should contain "504 Gateway"
