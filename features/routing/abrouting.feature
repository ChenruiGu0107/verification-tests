    Then the step should succeed
    Given I wait for the "service-secure" service to become ready
    Given I wait for the "service-secure-2" service to become ready
    # Create route and set route backends
    When I expose the "service-unsecure" service
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :set_backends client command with:
      | routename | service-unsecure      |
      | service   | service-unsecure=1    |
      | service   | service-unsecure-2=99 |
    Then the step should succeed
    # Scale pods
    When I run the :scale client command with:

      | replicas | 3                      |
    Then the step should succeed
    And all pods in the project are ready
    # Check the weight in haproxy.config
    Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    And I use the "default" project
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | deploymentconfig=router |
    Then evaluation of `pod.name` is stored in the :router_pod clipboard
    And I wait up to 5 seconds for the steps to pass:

    Then the output should contain 3 times:

    Given the "access.log" file is deleted if it exists
