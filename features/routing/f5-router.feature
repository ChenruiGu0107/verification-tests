  Scenario: the F5 routes change accordingly when the routes update
    Given F5 router public IP is stored in the :vserver_ip clipboard
    And admin ensures a F5 router pod is ready

    Given I have a project
    When I run oc create over "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/list_for_caddy.json" replacing paths:
      | ["items"][0]["spec"]["replicas"] | 1 |
    Then the step should succeed
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=caddy-pods |

    # create four type of routes
    When I expose the "service-unsecure" service
    Then the step should succeed

    Given I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/edge/route_edge-www.edge.com.crt"
    And I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/edge/route_edge-www.edge.com.key"
    And I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/ca.pem"
    When I run the :create_route_edge client command with:
      | name     | edge-route |
      | hostname | <%= rand_str(5, :dns) %>-edge.example.com |
      | service  | service-unsecure |
      | cert     | route_edge-www.edge.com.crt |
      | key      | route_edge-www.edge.com.key |
      | cacert   | ca.pem |
    Then the step should succeed

    When I run the :create_route_passthrough client command with:
      | name     | route-pass     |
      | service  | service-secure |
      | hostname | <%= rand_str(5, :dns) %>-pass.example.com |
    Then the step should succeed

    Given I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/reencrypt/route_reencrypt-reen.example.com.crt"
    And I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/reencrypt/route_reencrypt-reen.example.com.key"
    And I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/reencrypt/route_reencrypt.ca"
    And I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/reencrypt/route_reencrypt_dest.ca"
    When I run the :create_route_reencrypt client command with:
      | name       | route-reen |
      | hostname   | <%= rand_str(5, :dns) %>-reen.example.com |
      | service    | service-secure |
      | cert       | route_reencrypt-reen.example.com.crt |
      | key        | route_reencrypt-reen.example.com.key |
      | cacert     | route_reencrypt.ca |
      | destcacert | route_reencrypt_dest.ca |
    Then the step should succeed

    # check all routes if reachable from pod-for-ping
