  Scenario: Set CPU and memory limits by oc set resources
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/deployment/deployment1.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the pod named "hooks-1-deploy" becomes ready
    Given I wait for the pod named "hooks-1-deploy" to die

  Scenario: Set invalid vlaue for CPU and memory limits
    Given I have a project
    When I run oc create over "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/networking/list_for_pods.json" replacing paths:
      | ["items"][0]["spec"]["replicas"] | 1 |
    Then the step should succeed
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=test-pods |
    # Set resource for non-existing container
    When I run the :set_resources client command with:
      | resource     | rc           |

    Then the step should fail
    And the output should contain:
      | unable to find container named nonexisting |
    # Set invalid value for resource
    When I run the :set_resources client command with:
