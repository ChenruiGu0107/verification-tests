  Scenario: Pod will automatically be created by replicationcontroller when it was deleted
    Given I have a project
    And I run the :run client command with:
      | name         | myrun                 |
      | image        | yapei/hello-openshift |
      | generator    | run-controller/v1     |
      | -l           | rc=myrun              |
    Then the step should succeed

    When I wait until replicationController "myrun" is ready
    And I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | pod                |
      | l        | rc=myrun           |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain "myrun-"

    Given evaluation of `project.pods(by: user)[0].name` is stored in the :pod_name clipboard
    When I run the :delete client command with:
      | object_type | pod             |
      | l           | rc=myrun        |
    Then the step should succeed

    When I wait for the resource "pod" named "<%= cb.pod_name %>" to disappear
    And I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | pod                |
      | l        | rc=myrun           |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain "myrun-"
    And the output should not contain "<%= cb.pod_name %>"

  Scenario: Only scale the dc can scale the active deployment
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/deployment/testhook.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I wait until the status of deployment "hooks" becomes :complete
    # Workaround: the below steps make a failed deployment instead of using cancel
    Given I successfully patch resource "dc/hooks" with:
      | {"spec":{"strategy":{"recreateParams":{"pre":{ "execNewPod": { "command": [ "/bin/false" ]}, "failurePolicy": "Abort" }}}}} |
    When I run the :rollout_latest client command with:
      | resource | dc/hooks |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I wait until the status of deployment "hooks" becomes :failed
    Then I run the :scale client command with:
      | resource | ReplicationController |
      | name     | hooks-1               |
      | replicas | 2                     |
    Given I wait until number of replicas match "1" for replicationController "hooks-1"
    Then I run the :scale client command with:
      | resource | deploymentconfig |
      | name     | hooks            |
      | replicas | 1                |
    Given I wait until number of replicas match "1" for replicationController "hooks-1"

  Scenario: [openshift-sme]When rolling deployments the pod should shutdown gracefully
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/deployment/deployment-with-shutdown-gracefully.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I wait until the status of deployment "nettest" becomes :complete
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | app=nettest |
    Then evaluation of `pod.name` is stored in the :pod1_name clipboard
    Then evaluation of `pod.ip` is stored in the :pod1_ip clipboard
    When I run the :rollout_latest client command with:
      | resource | dc/nettest |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I wait until the status of deployment "nettest" becomes :complete
    Given the pod named "<%= cb.pod1_name %>" status becomes :running
    And I select a random node's host
    When I run commands on the host:
      | curl <%= cb.pod1_ip %>:8080/status -vv|
    Then the step should succeed
    And the expression should be true> @result[:response].include?("200 OK")

      | replicas | 2                     |
    Given I wait until number of replicas match "2" for replicationController "test-1"
    And I wait for the steps to pass:

    When I run the :get client command with:

  Scenario: HPA scale dc will update the deploymentconfig replicas
    Given I have a project
    Given SCC "privileged" is added to the "default" service account
