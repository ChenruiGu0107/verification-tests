    Given I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjryan/v3-testfiles/tc507557/templates/tc507557/application-template-dockerbuild-multivars.json"
    Given I replace lines in "application-template-dockerbuild-multivars.json":
      | registry.access.redhat.com/ | <%= product_docker_repo %> |
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | file | application-template-dockerbuild-multivars.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given 2 pods become ready with labels:
      |deployment=frontend-1|
    Given evaluation of `@pods[0].name` is stored in the :frontendpod clipboard
    When I execute on the "<%= cb.frontendpod %>" pod:
      | env |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain "RACK_ENV=production"

  Scenario: Order builds according to creation timestamps
    Given I have a project
    And I run the :new_app client command with:
      | file | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json |
    And I run the :start_build client command with:
      | buildconfig |  ruby-sample-build |
    And I run the :start_build client command with:
      | buildconfig |  ruby-sample-build |
    And I run the :start_build client command with:
      | buildconfig |  ruby-sample-build |
    And I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | builds |
    Then the output by order should match:
      | ruby-sample-build-1 |
      | ruby-sample-build-2 |
      | ruby-sample-build-3 |

  Scenario: Start build with option --wait
    Given I have a project
    And I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/build/tc512096/test-build-cancle.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I run the :start_build client command with:
      | buildconfig | sample-build |
      | wait        | true         |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I run the :start_build client command with:

      | wait        | true         |
      | commit      | deadbeef     |
    Then the step should fail
    And I run the :start_build background client command with:
      | buildconfig | sample-build |
      | wait        | true         |
    Given the pod named "sample-build-3-build" is present
    And I run the :cancel_build client command with:
      | build_name | sample-build-3 |
    And the output should match:
      | Build sample-build-3 was cancelled |

  Scenario Outline: when delete the bc,the builds pending or running should be deleted
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/build/tc<number>/test-buildconfig.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the "ruby-sample-build-1" build becomes <build_status>
    Then I run the :delete client command with:
      | object_type | buildConfig |
      | object_name_or_id | ruby-sample-build |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | buildConfig |
    Then the output should not contain:
      | ruby-sample-build |
    And I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | build |
    Then the output should not contain:
      | ruby-sample-build |

    Examples:
      | number | build_status |
      | 517369 | :pending     |
      | 517370 | :running     |
      | 517367 | :complete    |

    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/build/tc517366/test-buildconfig.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :describe client command with:

    Then the step should succeed
    And I run the :get client command with:
