  Scenario: Create a build config from a remote repository using branch
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :new_build client command with:
      | app_repo | https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world#beta2 |
      | l        | app=test |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource | bc |
      | name     | ruby-hello-world |
    Then the output should match:
      | URL:\s+https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world|
      | Ref:\s+beta2                                        |
    When I run the :start_build client command with:
      | buildconfig | ruby-hello-world |
    Then the step should succeed  
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | builds |
    Then the output should contain:
      | NAME                |
      | ruby-hello-world-1  |
    When I run the :get client command with:
      |resource| is |
    Then the output should contain:
      | ruby-20-centos7  |
      | ruby-hello-world |

  Scenario Outline: [origin_devexp_288] Push image with Docker credentials for build
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | app_repo        | <app_repo>                  |
      | context_dir     | <context_dir>               |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the "<first_build_name>" build was created
    And the "<first_build_name>" build completed
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource        | build                       |
      | name            | <first_build_name>          |
    Then the output should match:
      | Status:.*Complete                             |
      | Push Secret:.*builder\-dockercfg\-[a-zA-Z0-9]+|
    When I run the :new_secret client command with:
      | secret_name     | sec-push                    |
      | credential_file | <dockercfg_file>            |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :add_secret client command with:
      | sa_name         | builder                     |
      | secret_name     | sec-push                    |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | file            | <template_file>             |
    Given the "<second_build_name>" build was created
    And the "<second_build_name>" build completed
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource        | build                       |
      | name            | <second_build_name>         |
    Then the output should match:
      | Status:.*Complete                             |
      | Push Secret:.*sec\-push                       |
    When I run the :build_logs client command with:
      | build_name      | <second_build_name>         |
    Then the output should match "Successfully pushed .*<output_image>"
    Examples:
      | app_repo                                                            | context_dir                  | first_build_name   | second_build_name          | template_file | output_image | dockercfg_file |
