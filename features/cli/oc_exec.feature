  Scenario: Choose container to execute command on with '-c' flag
    Given I have a project
    And evaluation of `"doublecontainers"` is stored in the :pod_name clipboard
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | filename | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/pods/pod_with_two_containers.json|
    Then the step should succeed
    And the pod named "doublecontainers" becomes ready
    When I run the :exec client command with:
      | pod | <%= cb.pod_name %>  |
    #| c | hello-openshift |
      | exec_command     | cat               |
      | exec_command_arg |/etc/redhat-release|
    Then the output should contain:
      | CentOS Linux release 7.0.1406 (Core) |
    When I run the :exec client command with:
      | pod              | <%= cb.pod_name %>     |
      | c                | hello-openshift-fedora |
      | exec_command     | cat                    |
      | exec_command_arg | /etc/redhat-release    |
    Then the output should contain:

    # cover bug #1517212
    When I run the :exec client command with:
      | pod              | <%= cb.pod_name %>  |
      | t                |                     |

    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/pods/hello-pod.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the pod named "hello-openshift" becomes ready
    When I run the :get client command with:

  Scenario: Add env variables to postgresql-92-centos7 image
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/image/db-templates/postgresql-92-centos7-env-test.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | deployment=database-1 |
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | pods |
    Then the output should contain:
      | NAME            |
      | <%= pod.name %> |
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource | pod             |
      | name     | <%= pod.name %> |

      | Ready\\s+True                             |
    When I execute on the pod:
      | bash                |
      | -c                  |
      | env \| grep POSTGRE |

      | POSTGRESQL_SHARED_BUFFERS=64MB |
      | POSTGRESQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS=42  |
    When I execute on the pod:
      | bash                           |
      | -c                             |
      | psql -c 'show shared_buffers;' |
    Then the output should contain:
      | shared_buffers |
      | 64MB           |
    And I execute on the pod:
      | bash                            |
      | -c                              |
      | psql -c 'show max_connections;' |
    Then the output should contain:
      | max_connections |
      | 42              |

  Scenario: Executing commands in a container that isn't running
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/deployment/tc472859/hello-pod.json|
    And the pod named "hello-openshift" status becomes :pending
    And I run the :exec client command with:
      | pod | hello-openshift |
      | container | hello-openshift |
      | exec_command | ls      |
    Then the step should fail
    And the output should match:

  Scenario: oc exec, rsh and port-forward should work behind authenticated proxy
    Given I have a project
    And I have an authenticated proxy configured in the project
    And evaluation of `rand(5000..7999)` is stored in the :port1 clipboard
