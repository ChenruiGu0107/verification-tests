  Scenario: Export resource as json or yaml format by oc export
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | file | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/build/sample-php-centos7.json|
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource      | svc      |
      | resource_name | frontend |
      | export        | true     |
      | output        | json     |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I save the response to file> svc_output.json
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource      | dc       |
      | resource_name | frontend |
      | export        | true     |
      | output        | json     |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I save the response to file> dc_output.json

    Given I delete the project
    When I create a new project
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | svc_output.json |
      | f | dc_output.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | svc/frontend |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | dc/frontend |
    Then the step should succeed

      | name | deployment/hello-openshift |
      | max  | 2                          |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I wait for the "hello-openshift" hpa to appear

    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource  | deployment,hpa,job |
      | export    | true               |
      | output    | yaml               |
    Then the step should succeed
    # check for capitalized and missing fields (bug 1546443)
    And the output should not match "^ *[A-Z]"
    And the output should match "  metadata:$"
    And I save the output to file>export.yaml
    Given I ensure "hello-openshift" deployments is deleted
    And I ensure "hello-openshift" hpa is deleted
    And I ensure "pi" jobs is deleted
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | export.yaml |

  Scenario: Export resource as template format by oc export
    Given I have a project
    And I run the :create client command with:
      | filename | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/build/sample-php-centos7.json|
    Then the step should succeed
    And I create a new application with:
      | template | php-helloworld-sample |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | service |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain:
      | database |
      | frontend |
    And I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | dc |
    Then the step should succeed

    And I run the :export client command with:
      | resource | svc |
      | l | template=application-template-stibuild |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain:
      | template: application-template-stibuild |
    And evaluation of `@result[:response]` is stored in the :export_via_filter clipboard
    And I run the :export client command with:
      | resource | svc |
    And evaluation of `@result[:response]` is stored in the :export_all clipboard
    Given I save the response to file> export_all.yaml
    Then the expression should be true> cb.export_via_filter == cb.export_all
    When I delete the project
    Then the step should succeed
    And I create a new project
    And I run the :create client command with:
      | f | export_all.yaml |
