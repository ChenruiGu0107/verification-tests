  Scenario: Create clusterip service
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/services/hello-openshift.json |

    When I run the :create client command with:
      | help |  |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain "Create a service"

    And the output should contain:
      | tcp port |
    When I run the :create_service client command with:
      | createservice_type  | clusterip       |
