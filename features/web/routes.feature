  Scenario: Provide helpful error page for app 503 response
    Given the master version >= "3.5"
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
      | docker_image | openshift/hello-openshift:latest |
      | name         | hello                            |
    Then the step should succeed

    When I expose the "hello" service
    Then the step should succeed

    Given a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | app=hello |
    And evaluation of `pod.name` is stored in the :pod_name clipboard

    When I open web server via the "http://not-exist-<%= route("hello").dns %>/" url
    Then the output should contain:
      | Application is not available |
      | Possible reasons             |
      | The host doesn't exist       |
      | doesn't have a matching path |
      | all pods are down            |

    When I run the :expose client command with:
      | resource      | service |
      | resource_name | hello   |
      | path          | /test   |
      | name          | hello2  |
    Then the step should succeed

    When I open web server via the "hello2" route
    Then the output should contain:
      | Application is not available |
      | Possible reasons             |
      | The host doesn't exist       |
      | doesn't have a matching path |

    When I run the :scale client command with:
      | resource | dc    |
      | name     | hello |
      | replicas | 0     |
    Then the step should succeed
    And I wait for the resource "pod" named "<%= cb.pod_name %>" to disappear

    When I open web server via the "hello" route
    Then the output should contain:
      | Application is not available |
      | Possible reasons             |

  Scenario: Edit WildCard routes on web console
    Given the master version >= "3.5"
    Given I use the first master host
    And the "/etc/origin/master/wildcard.js" file is restored on host after scenario
    And I run commands on the host:
      | echo -n "window.OPENSHIFT_CONSTANTS.DISABLE_WILDCARD_ROUTES = false;" >/etc/origin/master/wildcard.js |
    And master config is merged with the following hash:
    """
    apiVersion: v1
    assetConfig:
      extensionScripts:
      - wildcard.js
    """
    And the master service is restarted on all master nodes
    Then the step should succeed

    Given admin ensures new router pod becomes ready after following env added:
      | ROUTER_ALLOW_WILDCARD_ROUTES=true |
    Then the step should succeed

    Given I switch to the first user
    And I login via web console
    And I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/edge/service_unsecure.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I perform the :create_route_specify_name_and_hostname_from_routes_page web console action with:
