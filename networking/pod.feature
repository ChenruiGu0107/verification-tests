  Scenario: The Completed/Failed pod should not run into TeardownNetworkError
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/networking/completed-pod.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And a pod is present with labels:
      | name=completed-pod |
    And evaluation of `pod.name` is stored in the :completed_pod clipboard
    Given the pod named "<%= cb.completed_pod %>" status becomes :succeeded
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/networking/failed-pod.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the pod named "fail-pod" status becomes :failed
    When I run the :describe client command with:
      | resource | pod |
      | name | <%= cb.completed_pod %> |
      | name | fail-pod |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should not contain "TeardownNetworkError"

  Scenario: containers can use vxlan as they want
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/networking/udp4789-pod.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the pod named "udp4789-pod" becomes ready
    And evaluation of `pod.ip` is stored in the :udp_pod clipboard
    Given I have a pod-for-ping in the project
    When I execute on the "hello-pod" pod:
      | bash |
      | -c |
      | (echo "Connection test to vxlan port") \| /usr/bin/ncat --udp <%= cb.udp_pod %> 4789 |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :logs client command with:
      | resource_name | udp4789-pod |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain "Connection test to vxlan port"

  Scenario: The pod MAC should be generated based on it's IP address
    Given I have a project
    And I have a pod-for-ping in the project
    And evaluation of `pod.ip` is stored in the :pod_ip clipboard
    When I execute on the pod:
      | bash |
      | -c   |
      | IP_ADDR=<%= cb.pod_ip %>; printf ':%02x' ${IP_ADDR//./ } |
    Then the step should succeed
    And evaluation of `@result[:response]` is stored in the :pod_mac clipboard
    When I execute on the pod:
      | bash |
      | -c   |
      | ip address show eth0 |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain:
      | link/ether 0a:58<%= cb.pod_mac %> |
      | inet <%= cb.pod_ip %> |

  Scenario: The broadcast IP address should not be assigned to a pod
    Given I select a random node's host
    And the node network is verified
    And the node service is verified

    # Get the node hostsubnet
    And evaluation of `host_subnet(node.name).subnet` is stored in the :hostnetwork clipboard
    # Get the max available IP
    And evaluation of `IPAddr.new("<%= cb.hostnetwork.chomp %>").to_range().max` is stored in the :broadcastip clipboard
    And evaluation of `IPAddr.new("<%= cb.broadcastip %>").to_i - 1` is stored in the :maxipint clipboard
    And evaluation of `IPAddr.new(<%= cb.maxipint %>, Socket::AF_INET).to_s` is stored in the :maxip clipboard
    # Write the max IP to the cni last reserved ip file
    When I run commands on the host:
      | printf "<%= cb.maxip %>" > $(find /var/lib/cni/networks/openshift-sdn/ -name "last_reserve*") |
    Then the step should succeed

    # Create a pod and make sure it will not use the broadcast ip
    Given I switch to the first user
    And I have a project
    When I run oc create over "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/scheduler/pod_with_nodename.json" replacing paths:
      | ["spec"]["nodeName"] | <%= node.name %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=nodename-pod |
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource      | pods |
      | o             | wide |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should not contain "<%= cb.broadcastip %>"

  Scenario: The completed pod should also have IP address
    Given I have a project
    And I run the steps 25 times:
    """
    When I run the :create client command with:

  Scenario: Other pod could work normally when a pod in high network io
    Given I have a project
    # setup iperf server to receive the traffic

      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/networking/egress-ingress/qos/iperf-server.json |

    Then the step should succeed
    And 2 pods become ready with labels:
      | name=iperf-pods |
    And evaluation of `@pods[-1].name` is stored in the :iperf_client1 clipboard
    And evaluation of `@pods[-2].name` is stored in the :iperf_client2 clipboard

    # run two pods with both ingress and egress to increase the network io
    When I run the :exec background client command with:
