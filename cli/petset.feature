  Scenario: Deleting the Pet Set will not delete any pets
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | <%= BushSlicer::HOME %>/features/tierN/testdata/petset/hello-petset.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given 2 pods become ready with labels:
      | app=hello-pod |
    When I run the :delete client command with:
      | object_type       | petset       |
      | object_name_or_id | hello-petset |
      | cascade           | true         |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I get project pods
    Then the output should contain:
      | hello-petset-0 |
      | hello-petset-1 |
    And the output should contain 2 times:
      | Running |

  Scenario: The only updatable field on a PetSet is replicas
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | <%= BushSlicer::HOME %>/features/tierN/testdata/petset/hello-petset.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given 2 pods become ready with labels:
      | app=hello-pod |
    When I run the :patch client command with:
      | resource      | petset                  |
      | resource_name | hello-petset            |
      | p             | {"spec":{"replicas":5}} |
    Then the step should succeed
    And 5 pods become ready with labels:
      | app=hello-pod |
    When I run the :patch client command with:
      | resource      | petset                              |
      | resource_name | hello-petset                        |
      | p             | {"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"hello-openshift","image":"aosqe/hello-openshift"}]}} |
    Then the step should fail
    And the output should contain "fields other than 'replicas' are forbidden"
