  Scenario: Extract configmap or secret from file
    Given I have a project
    Given a "secret.yaml" file is created with the following lines:
    """
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: test-secret
    data:
      data-1: dmFsdWUtMQ0K
      data-2: dmFsdWUtMg0KDQo=
    """
    Given a "configmap.yaml" file is created with the following lines:
    """
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: special-config
    data:
      special.how: very
      special.type: charm
    """
    When I run the :extract client command with:
      | f        | secret.yaml    |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given evaluation of `File.read("data-1")` is stored in the :data1_log clipboard
    Then the expression should be true> /value-1/ =~ cb.data1_log
    Given evaluation of `File.read("data-2")` is stored in the :data2_log clipboard
    Then the expression should be true> /value-2/ =~ cb.data2_log
    When I run the :extract client command with:
      | filename | configmap.yaml |
      | keys     | special.type   |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given evaluation of `File.read("special.type")` is stored in the :specialtype_log clipboard
    Then the expression should be true> /charm/ =~ cb.specialtype_log
    When I run the :extract client command with:
      | filename | no-exist       |
    Then the step should fail
    And the output should contain:
      | "no-exist" does not exist |
