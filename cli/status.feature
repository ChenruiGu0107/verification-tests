  Scenario: [origin_runtime_613]Get project status from CLI
    Given I have a project
    And I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/templates/ui/application-template-stibuild-without-customize-route.json"

    When I create a new application with:
      | file     | application-template-stibuild-without-customize-route.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the "ruby-sample-build-1" build was created
    Given the "ruby-sample-build-1" build becomes :running
    When I run the :status client command
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should match:
      |svc\/database\\s+-\\s+(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}:\\d+\\s+->\\s+3306|
      |svc\/frontend|
      |build.*1.*running    |
      |deployment.*waiting  |

    Given the "ruby-sample-build-1" build completed
    When I run the :status client command
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain:
      |frontend deploys |

    # check failed build
    When I run the :start_build client command with:
      |buildconfig|ruby-sample-build|
      |commit     |notexist         |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given the "ruby-sample-build-2" build failed
    When I run the :status client command
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should match:
      |build.*2.*fail|

    # TODO: cryan, this is a work around for AEP, please add step `the step should succeed` according to latest good solution
    Then I wait for the "myapp" service to be created
    When I run the :get client command with:
      | resource | projects |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should match "<%= project.name %>\s+Active"
    When I run the :status client command

    Then the step should succeed
    And the "ruby-ex-1" build was created
    When I run the :wait client command with:
      | resource      | dc                  |
      | resource_name | ruby-ex             |
